# udacity-disaster-response
Project #2 for Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree Program

## Project Motivation
We want to use data to see what emergency supplies people need in the event of a natural disaster. Different organizations will take care of different parts of the problem. E.g. one organization will care about water, another about blocked roads, another about medical supplies.

Purpose: to output a final model that uses the message column to predict classifications for 36 categories (multi-output classification)
